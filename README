Nautilus Launch
===============

A simple Nautilus extension that allows to run executables and launchers via
right-click menu


Usage
-----

Just install the extension, restart Nautilus and right-click on a launcher or
an executable. Launchers need to be valid in order to show the “Launch” menu
item.


Get involved
------------

The package needs help with internationalization. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **Nautilus Launch**. This
package comes with only eight strings to translate:

1. “Error retrieving file's path”
2. “Launcher has become invalid”
3. “Error retrieving current working directory”
4. “Error retrieving launcher's path”
5. “Launch all”
6. “Launch all the selected applications”
7. “Launch”
8. “Launch the selected application”

First thing to do is to make sure that `gettext` and `intltool` are installed
on your system. Then clone this repository and launch the following four
commands:

```
cd nautilus-launch/po
intltool-update -p
msginit -l nl
rm NautilusLaunch.pot
```

Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add a new line containing the abbreviated
name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the file `po/nl.po` and translate the eight strings above. All
you have to do now is to commit your changes.

If you want to update an existing Dutch translation to the most recent changes
in the extension source code, launch

``` sh
cd nautilus-launch/po
intltool-update -p
mv nl.po nl.po.bak && msgmerge nl.po.bak NautilusLaunch.pot > nl.po
rm NautilusLaunch.pot nl.po.bak
```

For any issue, [drop me a message][1].
